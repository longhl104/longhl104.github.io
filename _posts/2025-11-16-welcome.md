Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages, with full support for LaTeX mathematical equations.

## Inline Math

You can write inline equations using single dollar signs. For example, the equation $E = mc^2$ shows Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence.

Here's another example: The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.

## Display Math

For larger equations, use double dollar signs to display them on their own line:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

## More Complex Examples

### Matrix Notation

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus states:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$.

### Greek Letters and Symbols

You can use Greek letters like $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \Delta, \Sigma$ and symbols like $\infty, \nabla, \partial$.

### Summations and Products

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

$$
\prod_{i=1}^{n} i = n!
$$

## Code Syntax Highlighting

The blog also supports code syntax highlighting:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

## Creating New Posts

To create a new post:

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory
2. Name it using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Add front matter at the top with title, date, and layout
4. Write your content in Markdown with LaTeX support

Happy blogging!
