## Overview

Cloud-native applications are built from the ground up and optimized for cloud scale and performance. They're based on microservices architectures, use managed services, and take advantage of continuous delivery to achieve reliability and faster time to market.

## Scenario

Suppose you work on a team that wants to deploy cloud-native apps using Azure services. The team doesn't have a lot of experience using Azure for app deployments, so they've asked you to investigate.

You begin by:

1. Exploring the benefits of running containerized apps
2. Reviewing the container service options in Azure
3. Examining a reference solution architecture that includes the tools your team expects to use

## What You'll Learn

This module covers:

- **Examine cloud-native apps**: Understanding the principles and characteristics of cloud-native applications
- **Examine deployment options for cloud-native apps**: Exploring Azure's container services and when to use each
- **Review an Azure Container Apps solution architecture and resources**: Understanding the components and architecture patterns

## Module Goal

The goal of this module is to provide an overview of the tools and resources used to deploy containerized apps to Azure Container Apps. This includes:

- Accounts and subscriptions
- Azure resources
- Host environment resources
- Continuous deployment resources

## Why This Matters

By the end of this module, you'll understand:

- How cloud-native applications differ from traditional apps
- Which Azure services are best suited for containerized deployments
- The architecture components needed for a production-ready solution
- How to approach deploying your first cloud-native app on Azure

## What's Next

Let's start by examining what makes an application "cloud-native" and why this approach has become the standard for modern software development.
